### Defining Programming Paradigms
#### Exporing the Foundation of Programming Paradigms

- `Definition and Key Features` : Programming paradigms are conceptual framworks that defines how software is written,structured and executed.Thik of them as the philosophies of coding they guide how developers approach challenges and create solutions.

`Key features of paradigms include`:
1. `Problem breakdown`: How do we divide a problem into manageable parts?
2. `Logic structuring` : How do we organize operations for clarity?
3. `Data management` : How do we ensure data ensure data flows smoothly and securely.

- These paradigms are the backbone of software engineering,influencing every step from architecture to implementation.|

## Core Paradigms and their Characteristics

- `Imperative Paradigms` : Imperative programming provides detailed instruction to achieve task.It's like giving a robot step-by-step commands to complete an action.

- `Example use case`: In `Robotics`, where precise control is essential,imperative programming ensures that every motor,sensor,and action follows a well-defined sequences.

### Let's understand with Python code:

```
steps=["Move forward","Turn left","Pick up object"]
for step in steps:
    print(f"Robot executing:{step}")
```

- `Declarative Paradigm`: Declarative programming focus on `what need to be done`,not `how to do it`.This abstraction simplifies complex operations.

- `Example Use Case` : In `Cloud Infrastructure Management`,tools like `Terraform` let you declare the desired state of resources without worrying about implementation details,.

# Let's understand with terraform code
```
resources "aws_instances""web"{
    ami="ami-123456"
    instance_type="t2.micro"
}
```

- `Functional Paradigms`: Functional programming revolves around core functions and immutability,making it ideal for concurrent and data-intensive application.

- `Example use case`: In `AI pipelines`,functional paradigms ensure predictable transformations,enabling reliable model training.

## Let's understand with Python code.

```
def square(x):
    return x*x
numbers=[1,2,3,4]
squared=map(square,numbers)
print(list(squared))
```

- `Object-Oriented Paradigms(OOP)`:OOP organizes software into object that encapsulate data and behaviour,enabling modular and reusable code.

- `Example Use Case`: In `e-commerce platforms`,OOP models entities like product,user,and order,simplifying system expansion.

## Let's understand with python code

```
class Product:
    def __init__(self,name,price):
        self.name=name
        self.price=price
        
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.name}:${self.price}")
        
item=Product("Laptop",999.99)
item.display_info()
```

# Real-World Applications of Programming Paradigms

- `Imperative Paradigm in Action` : Imagine programming a `self-driving car's sensor system`.

- You must define precise step for `data collection`,`processing`,and `response` to ensure safetly and accuracy.

- `Declarative Paradigms in Data Science`: When querying a database,we don't define the process only focus on the output.

# Example : Using `SQL` to retrieve customer data

```SELECT*FROM customers WHERE purchase_history>1000:```

- `Functional Paradigm in AI` : Functional programming shines in managing `Data Pipelines`.

- Companies like `Netflix` rely on this paradigm to process preferences and deliver personalized recommendations.

- `In functional programming`
- We treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
- Functions avoid changing state and mutable data(i.e stateless or immuatable design)
- Data transformations often happen through higher-order functions like `map`,`filter`,and `reduce`


- Below is a small demonstration of how a `data pipeline` might look in a functional style.This simplistic pipeline represents readline user preference data,transforming it,and arriving at personalized recommendations.

```
from functools import reduce

def filter_high_rated_shows(show):
    """
    Example filter function: selects shows that have a rating >= 4
    """
    return show['rating'] >= 4

def extract_titles(show):
    """
    Example map function: extracts the 'title' of the show
    """
    return show['title']

def combine_recommendations(accumulated, new_title):
    """
    Example reduce function: collects titles into one list
    """
    return accumulated + [new_title]

def sort_shows_by_popularity(shows):
    """
    Another transformation: sorts shows by popularity descending
    """
    return sorted(shows, key=lambda s: s['popularity'], reverse=True)

def pipeline(shows):
    """
    Our entire data pipeline. 
    1. Sort shows by popularity
    2. Filter out low-rated shows
    3. Extract titles
    4. Reduce to build a recommendation list
    """
    sorted_shows = sort_shows_by_popularity(shows)
    
    # Filter
    filtered_shows = filter(filter_high_rated_shows, sorted_shows)
    
    # Map
    mapped_titles = map(extract_titles, filtered_shows)
    
    # Reduce
    recommendations = reduce(combine_recommendations, mapped_titles, [])
    
    return recommendations

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data: each show has a title, rating, and popularity
    sample_shows = [
        {"title": "Sci-Fi Adventures", "rating": 5, "popularity": 90},
        {"title": "Romantic Drama",    "rating": 3, "popularity": 70},
        {"title": "Comedy Central",    "rating": 4, "popularity": 85},
        {"title": "Action Blast",      "rating": 4, "popularity": 95},
        {"title": "Nature Documentary","rating": 5, "popularity": 65}
    ]
    
    recommendation_list = pipeline(sample_shows)
    print("Functional Programming - Recommended Titles:", recommendation_list)
```

1. `Pure Functions:`
- `filter_high_rated_shows`, `extract_titles`, and `combine_recommendations` each do one thing and do not alter any external state.
- They return new values based on input, fulfilling the stateless principle of functional programming.

2. `Higher-Order Functions:`

- `filter()` applies filter_high_rated_shows to the sorted list to keep only those that meet the rating criterion.

- `map()` applies extract_titles to transform each show dictionary into a show title (string).

- `reduce()` aggregates or combines multiple items into a single result—here, a list of recommended titles.

3. `Immutability:`

- The input data (`sample_shows`) is never mutated; instead, transformations (filter, map, reduce) generate new results at each stage.

4. `Real-World Use:`

- Netflix (as a big example) deals with enormous amounts of user preference data. They often pipeline data (transform, filter, and reduce) to derive recommended content.

- `Object-Oriented Paradigm in Mobile Apps` – Mobile apps like `WhatsApp` use OOP to manage features like messaging, calling, and user profiles.

- Each feature is an object that interacts seamlessly with others.

### Comparing Paradigms
### Imperative vs. Declarative

- `Imperative`: Defines how to perform a task, ideal for `firmware and robotics`.

- `Declarative`: Focuses on the result, perfect for `data queries` and `cloud setups`.

### Functional vs. OOP

- `Functional`: Ensures data consistency, best for real-time analytics.

- `OOP`: Encourages modularity, perfect for scalable applications.

### Benefits and Limitations
- `Imperative Paradigm`
    - `Pros`: Fine control over processes; easy to implement for simple tasks.
    - `Cons`: Becomes unwieldy for large systems.

- `Declarative Paradigm`
    - `Pros`: Simplifies complexity; abstracts processes.
    - `Cons`: Limited control over execution details.

- `Functional Paradigm`
    - `Pros`: Predictable and reliable; handles concurrency well.
    - `Cons`: Steeper learning curve for newcomers

- `Object-Oriented Paradigm`
