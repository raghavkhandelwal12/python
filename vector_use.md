# Role of Vectors in Large Language Models (LLMs)

Vectors are at the core of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and Claude understand and generate language. This document explains **where vectors are used** throughout the LLM pipeline.

## 1. Token Embedding

**What happens:**  
Text is broken into tokens, and each token is mapped to a fixed-size vector using an embedding layer.

**Why it's important:**  
It converts words into a numerical form that neural networks can understand.

**Example:**  
"lion" → [0.12, -0.44, ..., 0.98] (e.g., 768 dimensions)

## 2. Positional Encoding

**What happens:**  
Transformers don’t understand word order naturally. So, position vectors are added to token embeddings.

**Why it's important:**  
It helps the model understand word order and sequence.

**Formula:**  
Final Input = Token Embedding + Position Encoding

## 3. Self-Attention Mechanism

**What happens:**  
For each token, three vectors are generated:
- Query (Q)
- Key (K)
- Value (V)

**Attention Formula:**  
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q × Kᵀ / √d) × V

**Why it's important:**  
It lets the model focus on contextually important words (e.g., "king" attends to "lion").

## 4. Transformer Layers (Deep Representation)

**What happens:**  
Vectors are passed through multiple transformer layers with matrix operations, activations, normalization, and residual connections.

**Why it's important:**  
To extract deeper patterns and relationships in text.

## 5. Output Prediction (Softmax)

**What happens:**  
The final token vector is passed through a softmax layer to generate a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

**Why it's important:**  
This is how the model selects the next token during generation.


## 6. Sentence and Document Embeddings

**What happens:**  
LLMs can create a single vector to represent a sentence or document.

**Why it's important:**  
These embeddings are used for tasks like:
- Text classification
- Semantic search
- Clustering
- Recommendations


## 7. Vector Similarity and Retrieval (RAG)

**What happens:**  
In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), queries and documents are converted into vectors and stored in a vector database.

**Why it's important:**  
We use **cosine similarity** to retrieve relevant documents.

**Tools:** FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate


## 8. Training with Gradient Vectors

**What happens:**  
During training, vectors called gradients are used to update model weights.

**Why it's important:**  
Enables learning through backpropagation and optimization (e.g., using Adam optimizer).
