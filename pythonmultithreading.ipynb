    "A **process** is an instance of computer program that is being executed.Any process has 3 basic concepts.\n",

    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution.Also it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an os.In simple words a thread is a sequence  of such instructions within a  program that can executed independently of other code.A thread contain all this information  in a thread control block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thread identifier** : unique id(TIB) is assigned to every new thread\n",
    "- **Stack pointer** : Points to the thread stack in the process.The stack contains the local variable under the thread scope\n",
    "- **Program counter** : A register that stores the address of the instruction currently being executed by thread.\n",
    "- **Thread state** : can be running ,ready ,waiting,starting or done.\n",
    "- **Thread register set**: register assigned to thread for computations.\n",
    "- **Parent process pointer**: A pointer to process control bolock of the process that the thread lives on\n"
